# python-discord-bot
This is a python discord bot which is a base for cogs. It does nothing on its own but cogs can be added.  
You will need to add your Discord bot token, server id and owner id to the .env file.  
You will also need to modify the docker-compose.yml file to point to a your own directory in the volumes section.
